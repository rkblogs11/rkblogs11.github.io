  <h1>September 2023</h1>
  <h4>9/1</h4>
  <h4>It is finally September! I was so eager to leave school today!! We had so much fun hanging out at Rylan's house. First, we did lots of things on the trampoline. Next, we went to the Defy Trampoline Park! We had a good time at Defy doing various things, including dodgeball, parkour, and bouncing on the trampoline. After a very fun time at Defy, we went to 7/11 to go get Slurpees. A very fun night indeed!!!</h4>
  <h4>9/2</h4>
  <h4>Today was a fun Saturday. We went to the rib cook-off and saw friends. We did this fun bungee jumping-trampoline thing while we were there. The overall thing was very fun, but not as fun as yesterday!</h4>
  <h4>9/3</h4>
  <h4>Today we went to Grandma's house and chilled there for most of the day. Not too remarkable, other than the fact that we had brownies.</h4>
  <h4>9/4</h4>
  <h4>Today was again chill. It is Labor Day today, so that means that <em>I</em> get the day off from school. Today we harvested potatoes from the garden, we did pretty well. The whole wagon was almost full!</h4>
  (skipping to 9/10because im very forgetfull)
  <h4>9/10</h4>
  <h4>Today is the final day of the Reno Balloon races, we had lots of fun! We saw the "Dawn Patrol" which is the balloon show we got to see at five in the morning. After that we saw so many other balloons be inflated that it was almost to much.</h4>
