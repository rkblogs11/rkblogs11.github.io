<h1>July 2023 Blog</h1>
<h4>7/1</h4>
<h4>WE MADE IT TO VEGAS!! There are so many sights to see and so many things to do!!! There are roller coasters, monorails, replica towers, and many more things! We are staying in the MGM Signature hotel and the room is very fancy.</h4>
<h4>7/2</h4>
<h4>Today we <strong>really</strong> tired ourselves out. First, we took a walk around New York New York, which was 8000 steps around the place. Next, we go to the pool and splash around. After that, we enjoyed a delicious and relaxing dinner, with pizza. Then, we bought monorail tickets and went to the Circus Circus. But, the nearest monorail stop was .7 miles away. That was another 9000 steps. We used up about an hour but were sore and tired. Thus, we took a Lyft ride back to the monorail, the MGM, and then the rooms.</h4>

<h4>7/3</h4>
<h4>Today we went to the pool at MGM Grand, where they had a lazy river and a pool. After, we went to Paris (Las Vegas) and saw the (miniature) Eiffel Tower. While there, we got quite a few steps in. After Paris, we went to M&M World, where they sell a <strong>ton</strong> of M&M merch. Billy got a "custom" mug (it had his name on it but was not chosen by him). After going to the M&M World, we grabbed some ice cream and then went to a <em>fantastic</em> dinner show called <em>Tournament Of The Kings</em>. The show was lovely. It was also the last thing on our agenda</h4>
<h4>7/4</h4>
<h4>ITS THE FOURTH OF JULY!!!! Today we got to go to the pool one last time, the pool in Tower 2 was better than the Tower 3 pool, so we went there. Next, we went to dinner at a <em>fancy Chinese restaurant</em>, where they had barely any edible food (for me). During the dinner, I managed to get Wyatt's phone number, although I had to wait a while. Next, we went to the Fourth Of July Fireworks! They were shot off of the Ceaser's palace at 9 PM. This was the last thing I did today.</h4>
<h4>7/5</h4>
<h4>We left Vegas, but the vacation is not over yet! We went to Uncle Brian's house and got some snacks. There was a lot in Vegas, but here it is chill.</h4>
  <h4>7/6</h4>
  <h4> Tomorrow we leave for home, but for now, we will stay at Brian's house. We hiked up the little wash/creek down the street. While hiking, Billy found a rock and calls it 'Peter', I think it's coming home with us -_-.</h4>
  <h4>7/7</h4>
  <h4>WE'RE HOME!! We spent around 7 hours in the car. Before the car ride, I get little sleep, if any. I woke up at around 6 o'clock. 
 At about noon we stop for lunch at this cringy 50's diner. At 12:30 we set off again. We hit some traffic at 3, but Mom was annoyed with trying to pass a slow driver. The driver starts speeding up when we finally get into a passing lane. It was <strong>very annoying</strong>.</h4>
  <h4>7/8</h4>
  <h4>Today was our first 24 hours back home. Mom bought me a domain name for <a href = "https://riki-pedia.org">Rikipedia</a>, I was very happy about it. The domain was bought through <a href = "https://domains.google.com">Google Domains</a>, secured through <a href = "https://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>, and hosted on <a href = "https://github.com">GitHub</a>. I spent all day customizing it and registering it.</h4>
<h4>7/9</h4>
<h4>Today we set up the backyard pool, live-streamed on Fortnite a few times, and relaxed.</h4>
<h4>7/10</h4>
<h4>Today we went to get some lotto tickets (I am not using them), then, I streamed on Fortnite and splashed in the pool.</h4>
	<h4>7/11</h4>
	<h4>As the date above says, it's 7/11. Thus I got a <em>free</em> Slurpee. But, before that, I got to go to basketball pictures and they ripped us off. We weren't on the 'schedule'. Schedule my ball(er)s <em>bell photos</em>. We took our own photos with the crappy light they left behind</h4>
	<h4>7/12</h4>
	<h4>Today I continued translations for <a href = "https://riki-pedia.org">Rikipedia</a>, and prepared for my upcoming basketball game.</h4>
	<h4>7/13</h4>
	<h4>Today I had a basketball game, we lost but not by too many points. Before the game, I worked on Rikipedia all day, creating a newsletter and another article. During the game, I managed (idk how), to get a bump on my head.</h4>
	<h4>7/14</h4>
	<h4>Today I mainly worked on <a href = "https://en.riki-pedia.org">Rikipedia</a> and Rikipedia Newsletter, Riki-News for short. Had a <strong>delicous</strong> breakfast at IHOP, had a chocolate pancake with whipped cream and 2 cherries. <!--Fill in when basketball game is done--></h4>
