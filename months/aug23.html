<h1>August 2023 Blog</h1>
<h4>8/1</h4>
<h4>Today I was sick from yesterday and mainly lay on the couch all day. I believe we got our internet speeds back, but not entirely sure, because I was on the couch watching TV.</h4>
<h4>8/2</h4>
        <h4>Today, I am still sick, I went to the doctor and got some antibiotics (I have strep throat ). I might be able to go to the basketball game tomorrow.</h4>
        <h4>8/3</h4>
        <h4> I Got better, but still have symptoms, I made it to the game! I won the game with a lot of team points. But, sadly, Billy had to sub (he was not much of a help.)</h4>
        <h4>8/4</h4>
        <h4> I'm feeling even better than yesterday! My basketball game (back to back from yesterday) went well, we won 28-18 (ish). Other than the game, I mainly played games and watched TV.</h4>
        <h4>8/5</h4>
        <h4>I am almost fully better, I got a haircut today and a few more Newsletter subscribers. Mom drove some traffic by posting this on Facebook, which worked splendidly.</h4>
        <h4>8/6</h4>
        <h4>Rikipedia is still going very well, I released a dark theme to the Mailing list subscribers first, <strong> so subscribe to the list!</strong></h4>
        <h4>8/7</h4>
        <h4>Rikipedia has just released a new article explaining the success of Rikipedia. It is for mailing list subscribers, but only until the dark mode is out. Make sure to subscribe to the newsletter!</h4>
        <h4>8/8</h4>
        <h4>Today we had our final basketball game against the team I hate the most. The final score was 18-28 ish, we lost.</h4>
        <h4>8/9</h4>
        <h4>Today was a chill day, school starts soon.</h4>
        <h4>8/10</h4>
        <h4> I Played Fortnite with Eli (finally) and after a long, long, time, we got to play together.</h4>
        <h4>8/11</h4>
        <h4>It is Friday! The last Friday before school was quite boring. We decided it was a chill day today.</h4>
         <h4>8/12</h4>
        <h4>This Saturday was fun. We got to go to Rylan's house to see the fights.</h4>
<h4>8/24</h4>
        <h4> I finally return to this blog after a long break. School has been a real adventure so far, middle school can be tough. I have had lots of things to do and such little time for blogging and Rikipedia.</h4>
<h4>8/25</h4>
        <h4>Today was Friday, a quite boring day in school. During PE, we had to run a whole mile! It was tough and very stressful. I was breathing so hard that my lungs were hurting! <strong>It wasn't very good.</strong> The rest of the day went by pretty slowly. The new season in <a href = "https://fn.gg">Fortnite</a>. The in-game items were so overpowered! Read more about it <a href = "https://www.fortnite.com/chapter-4-season-4">here</a>. I am starting live-steam on it tomorrow on <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrvCzAz1zKQSX2Fqf2uru9Q">YouTube</a>.</h4>
        <h4>8/26</h4>
<h4>A very mellow Saturday indeed... We didn't do much, other than my BJJ class. We played Fortnite and did <strong>not</strong> stream to YouTube.</h4>
        <h4>8/27</h4>
        <h4>Today was a very calm Sunday. I mainly played Fortnite and watched YouTube. At 4 I went to Rylan's house and we had lots of fun. At the end of my stay, we were on the trampoline when the sprinklers came on. Instead of getting off like <em>'normal' people</em>, we decided to jump over the water beams. It was <strong>very</strong> fun.</h4>
        <h4>8/28</h4>
        <h4>A Monday to consider. I was very tired because I had to wake at <strong>6 in the morning.</strong><em>6 in the morning!</em>. Middle school has been a fun adventure so far. I hate having to wake up at <strong>6 in the morning</strong> but, other than that I like this adventure.</h4>
        <h4>8/29</h4>
<h4>Today was a good Tuesday. First, I went <em>woke up at six -_-</em>. I then proceed to <em>school --__--</em>. After 6 <em>boring</em> hours, I play <a href ="https://fn.gg">Fortnite</a>. I then needed to go pick up Billy, in the process I saw Rylan and my 
 Fifth grade. The rest was just Fortnite and being here now.</h4>
